# package-tracking
Django app that makes it easy for a package to be tracked, I decided to attempt
to build this app as a colleague mentioned it could be something clients would like,
The app is simple, a agent or courier could log in create a new packages and update where
the package is in transit, each time an update is made the customer gets a notifiction
email with a link to view the status of there parcel or package.

# Prerequisites

# Contributing
More than happy for developers of any level to contribute, just fork, create a
branch and push up for me to view.
